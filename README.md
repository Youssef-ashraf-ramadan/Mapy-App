# Project Mapty App

Welcome to the Mapty App project! This web application allows you to track your workouts by recording your location, distance, time, and other metrics using the browser's built-in geolocation and local storage APIs. You can create a new workout by selecting the type of activity (running or cycling), entering the workout details, and clicking on the map to set the starting and ending points of your workout.
